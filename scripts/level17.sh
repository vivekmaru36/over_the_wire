# The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000. First find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. Then find out which of those speak SSL/TLS and which don‚Äôt. There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- MESS ------------------------------
# That means the service is expecting the password for bandit16, not bandit15.

# Here‚Äôs why:

# You are currently logged in as bandit16.

# The .bandit15.password file you looked at is the old password you used to get into bandit16.

# To continue, you need to send the current level‚Äôs password (bandit16‚Äôs) to the SSL service on port 31790, not the bandit15 one.

# But notice: you don‚Äôt know bandit16‚Äôs password yet ‚Äî that‚Äôs exactly what you‚Äôre supposed to get back from this SSL service.

# The catch is: this service expects you to provide the current (bandit16) password to authenticate first. But you don‚Äôt have that yet ‚Äî so the trick is actually:

# üëâ You must pass the bandit16 password stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit16 (accessible only if you‚Äôre root) OR get it through the designed pipeline using bandit15 ‚Üí bandit16 ‚Üí 31790.

# The reason you see the error is that you sent the wrong password (bandit15‚Äôs).

# üîë Hint to solve properly:

# The service on port 31790 is the "SSL shell" that gives you the next password (for bandit17).

# To access it, you need to send bandit16‚Äôs password (not bandit15‚Äôs).

# But bandit16‚Äôs password is actually in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit16, which you cannot read directly unless you use the right method (the trick is to use the password from .bandit15.password to ssh into bandit16 in the first place).



# password is here for level 18.sh i know its an rsa key we can't do anything

# verify return:1

# Correct!
