# A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

# NOTE: This level requires you to create your own first shell-script. This is a very big step and you should be proud of yourself when you beat this level # nahh i am noob

# NOTE 2: Keep in mind that your shell script is removed once executed, so you may want to keep a copy aroundâ€¦

# nahh how can -a mean 'And' operator in bash 
# the script deleted everything crteated by bandit23 within a 60 second timeout and it deletes everything from /var/spool/bandit23/ files but before deleting it executes it
# the script explanation with exploit that i can use : https://chatgpt.com/share/68b2c9f9-2f9c-8006-be9e-b35e891c4321
# so basically if i create a script and paste it inside the /var/spool/bandit24 file it will run it as bandit 24 which we can exploit to cat the pass of bandit24

# i can't solve it the script won't run don't know why !
